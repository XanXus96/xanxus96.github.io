I am a very passionate software engineer, throughout my journey i have used various programming languages in different fields: java for desktop web and mobile; c; c++; ruby; python.. but my work for the time being mainly focuses on web development, using php and its framework, javascript with vuejs and Nuxt.js in particular besides using nodejs with express, mongoDB and some graphQL.
I had got this idea of starting a blog to share with you fellas anything that may help you in anyway it can do, i am not perfect so feel free please to ping me if you find any trouble or errors in my blog.
Cheers and let it sink.
